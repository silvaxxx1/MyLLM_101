# MyLLM: Notebooks

The `MyLLM/notebooks` directory provides a structured, step-by-step roadmap for building this repository from data collection and preprocessing to fine-tuning. Each notebook guides you through the process of developing large language models (LLMs) from scratch, utilizing first principles to ensure a deep understanding of the underlying methods.

## Purpose

This collection of Jupyter notebooks serves as both a tutorial and a practical guide for users interested in the complete lifecycle of LLM development. It covers essential topics, including data preparation, model architecture, training, and evaluation, enabling users to adapt pre-trained models to their specific tasks.
