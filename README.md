# MyLLM: LLM from Zero to Hero üöÄ

Welcome to **MyLLM**, where we‚Äôre on a thrilling adventure to build a comprehensive Large Language Model (LLM) that takes you from data to deployment! This project isn‚Äôt just about text generation; it‚Äôs a full-fledged exploration into the world of natural language processing. Let‚Äôs dive in!

## Project Overview

In the wild and wonderful realm of NLP, crafting a large language model requires a blend of art and science. With **MyLLM**, we aim to provide a roadmap to creating an LLM that not only generates text but can also handle a plethora of tasks. Join us as we turn ideas into code!

### Key Features

- **End-to-End Training Pipeline**: We‚Äôll guide you through every step‚Äîfrom data gathering to model deployment‚Äîso you can unleash the power of your LLM.
- **Advanced Training Techniques**: Experience the magic of training with cutting-edge strategies like learning rate warm-up, cosine decay, and gradient clipping to supercharge your model's performance.
- **Versatile Applications**: This isn‚Äôt just text generation; MyLLM is designed for a wide array of NLP tasks, making it a go-to tool for all your AI needs.

### Current Status ‚úÖ

Here‚Äôs what we‚Äôve accomplished so far:

- **Data Pipeline & Preprocessing**: Streamlined data collection and cleaning for optimal training.
- **Custom Dataloader**: Built a dataloader that feeds our model the right data at the right time.
- **Model Development**: Created a transformer architecture from scratch using PyTorch.
- **Training Loop Implementation**: Developed a robust training loop that handles the learning process.
- **Weight Loading**: Integrated the ability to load pre-trained weights into the model for improved performance.
- **Develop a User Interface**: Make it user-friendly with an engaging UI.
