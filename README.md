# MyLLM: LLM from Zero to Hero üöÄ

Welcome to **MyLLM**, where we‚Äôre on a thrilling adventure to build a comprehensive Large Language Model (LLM) that takes you from data to deployment! This project isn‚Äôt just about text generation; it‚Äôs a full-fledged exploration into the world of natural language processing. Let‚Äôs dive in!

## Project Overview

In the wild and wonderful realm of NLP, crafting a large language model requires a blend of art and science. With **MyLLM**, we aim to provide a roadmap to creating an LLM that not only generates text but can also handle a plethora of tasks. Join us as we turn ideas into code!

### Current Status ‚úÖ

Here‚Äôs what we‚Äôve accomplished so far:

- **Data Pipeline & Preprocessing**: Streamlined data collection and cleaning for optimal training.
- **Custom Dataloader**: Built a dataloader that feeds our model the right data at the right time.
- **Model Development**: Created a transformer architecture from scratch using PyTorch.
- **Training Loop Implementation**: Developed a robust training loop that handles the learning process.
- **Distributed Training Strategy**: Successfully implemented distributed training to scale up model training for efficiency.
- **Weight Loading**: Integrated the ability to load pre-trained weights into the model for improved performance.
- **Develop a User Interface**: Make it user-friendly with an engaging UI.
